# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019
  Software developed for NASA Hackathon, as part of the challenge proposed in
  2019.

### About

The company challenged the participants with a lot of project options in many different knowledge areas, and everyone should choose only one.

My group identified a bit more with the "Earth's Oceans" category, and then developed an application in "Rising Water" section.

Our solution is a mobile app that communicates users \(local population\) about the impacts of rising oceans in the world \(and in their own lives\), showing them these changes graphically. The program is capable of realizing simulations, as well as alerting people if a disaster is on the way. All of this is only possible because data is being received in real-time from monitoring platforms \(NASA Databases and others\).

Users have the following variables available to predict future situations:

* Sea Surface Temperature
* Melting of ice
* Tide
* Lunas Phase
* Year \(projection under statistical data\)
